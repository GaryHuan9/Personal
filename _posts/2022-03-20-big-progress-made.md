# Introduction
Welcome to the third sprint! Although exams and homework from other classes made me very busy, I am still quite proud of the progress that I have made for the game. 

# Down Kick
*1.5 hours*
The down kick is an attack manuever feature that has been delayed for three sprints because of other backend issues (I briefly discussed this in the last blog). With the changes to the character movement system done, I can now finally implement down kick. As described by the documentations from the design department, the down kick should activate when the player is airborne during a jump, and they simultaneously trigger the down and attack button.

I created another attack type using the existing attacking system, introduced a new animation trigger, and mapped this new kick to a new set of sprite names. The set of sprites that we intended to use for the down kick was still not available when I completed implementing this feature, hence I just used the regular attack animation as a placeholder. But as of the writing of this blog, the animation has been replaced by the art department, so I can show you some pictures.

The next tasks that I was assigned are related to the level completed screen, along with the score displays and score system. Naturally, I started working on the backend, which is the score system. I added methods that collect the various information such as player hit count and health, process
