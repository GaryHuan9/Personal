# Meetings & Logistics
*6 hours*

As per usual, all of the logistics, meetings, and communications actually take quite a big chunk of time. We had a separate group chat with just the Boss programmers and had conversations about different implementation details throughout the weeks. This was really helpful to avoid clustering the main server while still knowing what others have worked on. Finally, I am not sure how much time other members of the Studio spend on these blog posts, but all of the official blog posts that I made took me more than two hours.

# Conclusion
Here is my time breakdown for this sprint: ` + 6 = 18`.
